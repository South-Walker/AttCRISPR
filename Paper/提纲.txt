    A sigmoid function is used to map the final result to a range of zero to one at last,

\caption{        
    Details of temporal attention module. 
    To generate the first order preference vector in the $i$ position of sgRNA $\tilde{A}_i$. 
    First, the $i$-th row vector of the querys matrix $Q_i$ is multiplied by the transpose of the keys mateix $K^T$, and apply a softmax function to obtain a preliminary weights vector on the values. 
    Second, to favor the alignment points near $i$, the weights vector obtained is multiplied element-by-element by the $i$-th row vector of the damping matrix $G$, as Equation~(\ref{eq:17}) has shown. 
    $G_{ij}$ can be regarded as the result of place a Gaussian distribution centered around $i$, then sampling the position $j$ (a scaling factor is used to ensure the sum of $G_I$ is $l$). 
    Then we achieve the second-order preference matrix $B$, it is also a weights matrix on the values. So the first-order preference matrix $\tilde{A}$ come from the product of $B$ and values matrix $V$.
    Temporal attention module generates the temporal first-order preference matrix $\tilde{A}$ and the temporal second-order preference matrix $B$.
