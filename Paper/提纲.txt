\begin{itemize}
    \item Present a novel deep-learning-based model, which can extract potential feature representation of sgRNA sequence in both spatial and temporal domain parallelly. 最终通过集成学习的方法将二者结合，以获取更好的表现
    It doesn't belong to any of the above categories of existing approaches.
    \item Introduce attention mechanism into our model. 
    As a result, It does not need post hoc explanations techniques based on input perturbation to explain itself. 
    It is intrinsic interpretable in both temporal and spatial domains.
In the spatial it's at the nucleotide level , in our word, first-order interpretable, while at the overall level in the temporal domains, in our word, second-order interpretable. Thus, it is transformed from a black box to an intrinsically interpretable model with the performance of deep learning based model. 
    \item Throught abation analysis and testing a series of possible network structure, 
    we find there are multiple components and strategy can improve the performance of our model and constructed AttCRISPR, 
    which could outperform the current state-of-the-art tool on deepHF dataset.\vspace*{1pt}

最近基于残差网络的讨论似乎揭示了（xxx等人）残差块可以辅助过深或过复杂的神经网络的学习。（残差思想首次在该任务中运用）
（我们使用insertion/deletion（indel）值表示sgRNA的活性标签，其虽然not equal to real gene knockout efficiency.但有研究证明其与后者有良好的相关性[nc]，而且after genome editing ,PCR-amplifing the target sequences for deep sequencing, the indel rate induced by Cas9 nucleases is enable to be direct measured )
( the functional and structural information of a biological sequence are intrinsically encoded within its primary sequence.,出于这一信念我们一开始先构建的end2end模型)
