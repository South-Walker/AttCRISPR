abstract={CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.},

pages={1037-1043},
abstract={Base editors, including adenine base editors (ABEs)1 and cytosine base editors (CBEs)2,3, are widely used to induce point mutations. However, determining whether a specific nucleotide in its genomic context can be edited requires time-consuming experiments. Furthermore, when the editable window contains multiple target nucleotides, various genotypic products can be generated. To develop computational tools to predict base-editing efficiency and outcome product frequencies, we first evaluated the efficiencies of an ABE and a CBE and the outcome product frequencies at 13,504 and 14,157 target sequences, respectively, in human cells. We found that there were only modest asymmetric correlations between the activities of the base editors and Cas9 at the same targets. Using deep-learning-based computational modeling, we built tools to predict the efficiencies and outcome frequencies of ABE- and CBE-directed editing at any target sequence, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.50 to 0.95. These tools and results will facilitate modeling and therapeutic correction of genetic diseases by base editing.},

    abstract = "{The prediction of off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 is a hot topic due to its relevance to gene editing research. Existing prediction methods have been developed; however, most of them just calculated scores based on mismatches to the guide sequence in CRISPR-Cas9. Therefore, the existing prediction methods are unable to scale and improve their performance with the rapid expansion of experimental data in CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, the existing methods still cannot satisfy enough precision in off-target predictions for gene editing at the clinical level.To address it, we design and implement two algorithms using deep neural networks to predict off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (i.e. deep convolutional neural network and deep feedforward neural network). The models were trained and tested on the recently released off-target dataset, CRISPOR dataset, for performance benchmark. Another off-target dataset identified by GUIDE-seq was adopted for additional evaluation. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network achieves the best performance on CRISPOR dataset, yielding an average classification area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 97.2\\% under stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Interestingly, the deep feedforward neural network can also be competitive at the average AUC of 97.0\\% under the same setting. We compare the two deep neural network models with the state-of-the-art off-target prediction methods (i.e. CFD, MIT, CROP-IT, and CCTop) and three traditional machine learning models (i.e. random forest, gradient boosting trees, and logistic regression) on both datasets in terms of AUC values, demonstrating the competitive edges of the proposed algorithms. Additional analyses are conducted to investigate the underlying reasons from different perspectives.The example code are available at https://github.com/MichaelLinn/off\_target\_prediction.

abstract={Protein secondary structure (SS) prediction is important for studying protein structure and function. When only the sequence (profile) information is used as input feature, currently the best predictors can obtain {\textasciitilde}80{\%} Q3 accuracy, which has not been improved in the past decade. Here we present DeepCNF (Deep Convolutional Neural Fields) for protein SS prediction. DeepCNF is a Deep Learning extension of Conditional Neural Fields (CNF), which is an integration of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and shallow neural networks. DeepCNF can model not only complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical architecture, but also interdependency between adjacent SS labels, so it is much more powerful than CNF. Experimental results show that DeepCNF can obtain {\textasciitilde}84{\%} Q3 accuracy, {\textasciitilde}85{\%} SOV score and {\textasciitilde}72{\%} Q8 accuracy, respectively, on the CASP and CAMEO test proteins, greatly outperforming currently popular predictors. As a general framework, DeepCNF can be used to predict other protein structure properties such as contact number, disorder regions and solvent accessibility.},

These features are used to develop a bioinformatics tool for genome-wide design of sgRNAs with improved efficiency.

The CRISPR-associated (Cas)9 can be programmed with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to generate site-specific DNA breaks, but there are few known rules governing on-target efficacy of this system. We created a pool of sgRNAs, tiling across all possible target sites of a panel of six endogenous mouse and three endogenous human genes and quantitatively assessed their ability to produce null alleles of their target gene by antibody staining and flow cytometry. We discovered sequence features that improved activity, including a further optimization of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. The results from 1,841 sgRNAs were used to construct a predictive model of sgRNA activity to improve sgRNA design for gene editing and genetic screens. We provide an online tool for the design of highly active sgRNAs for any gene of interest.},
